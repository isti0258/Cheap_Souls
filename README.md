# Cheap_Souls

A third person, souls-like game demo, made in unreal engine (c++). The game would include PVM combat and 1 basic quest with the main goal of killing the boss. We would create at least 2 playable areas, one where the boss fight will take place,and an NPC filled map where the player controlled character can start the main questline and prepare for the bossfight.
